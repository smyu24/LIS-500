                    <p><strong>Dui Cao</strong> - I am a fourth-year college student majoring in Information Science. Passionate about basketball and CS2 (Counter-Strike 2), I enjoy challenging myself in games and improving my technical and tactical skills. 
                    
                    Apart from academics and gaming, my dog XiuXiu is an important part of my life. He has been my best companion, bringing joy and relaxation. Looking ahead, I hope to apply information science to real-world applications while continuing to grow in sports and gaming.</p>

                    <p><strong>Seung-min Yu</strong> - Technology has always fascinated me, especially mechanical keyboards. The satisfying click of each keypress, their durability, and customization make them feel like an extension of myself. Whether gaming, coding, or working on projects, the precision and feedback of a mechanical keyboard enhance my experience. It’s not just a tool—it’s a passion that blends functionality and personality.</p>
