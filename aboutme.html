            <h2>Who we are </h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Dui Cao, a fourth-year college student majoring in information science. I am passionate about basketball and CS2 (Counter-Strike 2), and I like to challenge myself in games and constantly improve my technical and tactical understanding.

                In addition to my studies and hobbies, I have a special presence in my life - my dog XiuXiu. He is my best friend and has accompanied me through many happy times. I like to walk and play with it, looking at its naughty and lovely look can always make me relax.
                
                In the future, I hope to apply the knowledge of information science to practical scenarios and explore how technology can improve people's lives. At the same time, I also look forward to making progress in basketball and CS2, and enjoying the passion and fun brought by competition!</p>

            <p>Hi, my name is Seung-min Yu."I've always had a passion for technology and the tactile experience of typing, which is why I fell in love with mechanical keyboards. The satisfying click of each keypress, the durability, and the ability to customize my setup make it feel like a true extension of myself. Whether I'm gaming, coding, or just typing away on a project, the precision and feedback of a mechanical keyboard make every task more enjoyable. It's not just a toolâ€”it's a part of my daily routine, and I love how it combines functionality with personality."</p>
