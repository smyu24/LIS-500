            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our website! This site explores power relations in the tech industry, implicit bias, and how to drive fairness by race, class, and gender. Here you will find an introduction to me, a resource guide, and an introduction to a "tech hero" who is challenging the status quo and pushing for fairness in technology.</p>

            <p>In today’s rapidly evolving tech industry, power is often concentrated in the hands of a few, shaping the opportunities available to underrepresented groups. Implicit bias—unconscious attitudes and stereotypes—plays a significant role in determining who gets hired, promoted, and recognized. These biases can reinforce structural inequalities, making it harder for marginalized communities to thrive in the tech space.</p>

            <p>Our goal is to shed light on these issues and offer insights into how individuals and organizations can foster a more inclusive and diverse environment. We highlight the stories of those who are actively working to challenge these biases and create a fairer, more equitable industry.</p>

            <p>We encourage you to explore the resources, learn from real-world examples, and reflect on how you can contribute to a more just and inclusive tech landscape. Change starts with awareness, and together, we can make a difference!</p>

            <h2>About Implicit Bias</h2>
            <p>Implicit bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions unconsciously. These biases shape how people interact with technology and the workplace.</p>
